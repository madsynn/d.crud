scaffold:update 
Keep a running list of your model definitions

There is now a scaffold:update command and it is very cool! In your config file, you will have an option to specify a "modelDefinitions" file, and in this you will place all of your model definitions. See below for an example.


resource = true
namespace = Oxford
University hasMany Department string( name city state homepage ) -nt
Department belongsTo University, hasMany Course string( name description ) number:integer
resource = false
Course belongsTo Department, hasMany Lesson string( name description ) integer( number credits ) -sd

When you update this file and run php artisan scaffold:update it will check to see what has changed and update your models/migrations automatically! It will keep a "cache" file in the same directory as your models file to track the changes, so DO NOT EDIT IT! This allows the command to know if anything has been removed.


Want to go even FURTHER with the scaffold process?!?! Setup foreman, add jrenton/laravel-scaffold to the require-dev section, setup an app file to copy from that adds the laravel scaffold service provider, setup a database file that sets up your database to copy from, and finally setup a models.txt file to copy from (example above). Save that scaffold file somewhere convenient.

Then, you can edit your bash file to include a new alias:

alias laravel="foremancreate"
foremancreate(){
    foreman build /path/to/htdocs/folder/$1 /path/to/scaffold.json
    cd /path/to/htdocs/folder/$1
    composer update
    php artisan scaffold:file "app/models.txt"
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan db:seed
}


Then run laravel project-name and watch as your application is fully built and scaffolded for you :)
