ABOUT THE QNIQUE QUILTING MACHINE
BY NATHAN ERZNOZNIK, MARCH 23, 2015
The Qnique Quilter Makes it Easy to Create Quilting Masterpieces

From early times women have sewn quilts from leftover bits of fabric to cover their beds and keep their families warm, but the sewing was done by hand since they did not have sewing machines then. The work was tedious and it took many hours to finish just one quilt. Women often got help from their neighbors and family members to finish the quilt in just one day, and each member of the group got help in making their own quilt. These gatherings were known as quilting bees, and served as social activities as well as work days.

The modern sewing machine has made sewing a quilt much faster and easier than in pioneer days, but it is still necessary for a quilter to learn the intricate details of the art. It takes much more than looking through pattern books to find the right piece and then following the directions to make the quilt. Today’s quilting machine is equipped with multiple accessories, so the operator must learn how to use them correctly.

The intricate stitches needed to create beautiful patterns on quilts should be uniform in length and consistency, and the Qnique Quilting Machine’s built-in regulation ensures perfect stitches. Highly detailed patterns are not difficult to create using this state of the art machine that uses laser technology to exactly follow the outline of images or patterns. Learning to use the Qunique Quilter is relatively easy by following the directions in the instruction books that are included, and online advice is always available.

The Qnique Quilter is a state of the art machine that gives the operator all the tools needed to create pieces that are beautiful enough to sell at craft shows or online. Many women even find a satisfying career in making and selling quilts, and the Qnique quilting machine can make this occupation much easier and more profitable. People who sew quilts and accessories at home to sell at shows or online are able to turn out more finished projects when they have a quilting frame. This modern machine is designed to work perfectly on many existing frames, and includes at complete set of instructions to set it up on various quilting frames.

Considering the many benefits of owning a Qnique Quilting Machine, prospective buyers might be concerned about its high cost. The cost of comparable longarm quilting machines typically falls between $6,000 to $18,000, but the Qnique Quilter can be purchased for less than any other long arm quilting machine on the market today. With this incredibly reasonable price the Qnique offers all the advantages of the higher price machines, plus finger-tip controls for ease of operation. Although the Qnique is not classified as a long-arm machine, its 15″ throat length offers the operator the ability to sew most patterns effortlessly.

Quilting is a creative hobby that many women enjoy, and they make lovely quilts and accessories for their own home or as gifts. Other women have begun to sell their beautiful projects at shows, in a local quilt shop or online. Unless a quilter is focused on sewing and selling quilts and accessories as a career, she may not have considered purchasing a quilting machine for her home. However, the reasonable cost and high performance level of the Qnique Quilting Machine could make the purchase a possibility. Although it is not likely that anyone who purchases this machine would want to return it, the company policy does have a return policy due to defects with or dissatisfaction with its performance.

GRACES OWN KARLA GEROME EXPERT QUILTER

http://www.qniquequilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/feather-corner.jpg

Karla Gerome
Expert Quilter for 25 years. Daughter of our Famous “Grace” founder of The Grace Company

Here are some of the things I’m learning as I become more familiar with free motion quilting.  First—if you don’t like it, unpick it!!!  When I first started on this quilt, I was really struggling with border designs.  I watched quilting video after quilting video, and I practiced on paper design after design.  My first attempt was a curved feather pattern.  My curves were wobbly and it looked terrible—the feathers just plain ugly!  So I unpicked it. My mother (Grace of the Grace Company) always told me, “You know Karlie, you just won’t be happy with it the way it is, so you might as well unpick and do it right.”  Oh yes! When you spend so much time piecing a quilt you want it to look like you pictured it in your mind.

As a side note, during this attempt I used a black marking pencil that was supposed to come off the fabric. It probably will—with time—but it is still there. Lesson learned—don’t use the dark marking pencils!!!!
Then one day I was watching an APQS video. She was doing an overall design she called swans, which was pretty and was also one I felt confident that I could quilt. So I practiced on paper and was ready to try quilting it on the border.  It looked okay, but still it was not the overall design I wanted.  So again, I unpicked.    My third attempt was again a feather design, which is the one you see now. I like it, and I’d practiced it several times on paper so I was somewhat confident.



Before putting the quilt back on the frame, I measured it in sections just by folding it so I had four equal sections. Then I found the center of those sections and marked them.  I measured half an inch from the top and a quarter inch from the bottom, and then I found the center between those two lines.  I marked and made my straight line in each section, drew my heart top and bottom, and then drew my feathers in chalk.  Then I summoned up the courage and tried to quilt the heart top and bottom of one of the sections.  Needless to say, I was so worried about making a mistake that it was all wobbly, and so—yes, I unpicked it.

sun-quilt block

I decided to do another practice run on my side practice pieces, and it turned out great! I didn’t move it so slow, trying to stay on the line I had drawn.  Sometimes quilting is like learning to ride a bike—the slower you go the more wobbly you are. So just start peddling and you will get smoother and more confident, and before long we will all look like great quilters.



The mariners compass circles were another great challenge to my quilting experience that has helped me become better at free motion quilting.  I tried making loops around the circles in all four corners; however, I really didn’t like it, so yes, again I unpicked it.  I am okay with my feather design, but I’d probably do something different if I could figure out just what I wanted.  So, for the inside of the compass I also tried to make loops, figuring that they would look good. Boy, was I wrong there!  Through trial and error, I figured out that I needed to do each section without stopping.

Many quilters who have been quilting free motion have already learned these things.  It’s new for me because I would always piece the tops and let my sister Sally quilt them. However, now that she is retired, I get to learn how to quilt my own quilts.  While it is challenging, it is also rewarding to learn and figure out these designs.  This mariners compass top was made because I saw the pattern and decided to make one. I found the design and used the paper piecing method to sew it.  I chose red and yellow fabrics because my favorite color is red and my husband’s is yellow.  We have four children, so the four outside compasses represent them, and the one is the middles is ours.  I hope to get it quilted soon and start on another top, since there are so many to do and always more to come!



I look forward to sharing my quilting journey with you all. I hope that I can help inspire and encourage quilters everywhere to find a good unpicking tool and try something new.  You will be frustrated with yourself, excited when you find the solution, and happy with the results at the end of your quilt.

GREAT QNIQUE QUILTER REVIEW !

http://www.qniquequilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC01152.JPG


Qnique user in UK has this great blog, check it out.

Review of Q’nique Quilting Machine.

I’ve had my Q’nique now for a few weeks and we are getting along just fine. The Q’nique 14+ is a quilting machine made by the Grace Company. It has almost 15″ of quilting space hence it is called the 14+.




My set up before I got this machine was a Janome 1600P on a queen Gracie frame. The Q’nique was designed to go on the Grace frame and to get the 14+ to sit on the frame, the professional carriage is required.  Luckily I had this.  The top section with the handles comes off and then encoders are added.

My husband, who is an engineer was able to do this with ease.


I would not have been able to do this myself but customer support has been fantastic.


At this point I should say I live in the UK and bought my machine from The Cotton Patch who are situated in Birmingham. Geoff and the team have been great as regards to follow up calls, making sure everything is ok.


You can also chat live online. to the guys from The Grace co, which is great.


Now back to the machine, I don’t really know where to start.  the best thing has to be the huge arm space.  After 2 years of working within a 7″ or less space, it is a massive luxury to have this extra space and is the main reason the machine was bought.


I have my frame set up to work from the front as I only do freehand work, no pantos.


The controls are at your finger tips in the handles which are at comfortable angle and you can see all your settings on this screen. There are 4 different sewing modes. I am using the precise regulated for designs like feathers but I also like the manual mode for doing designs like pebbling or stippling.



It also has a counter for the total stitches and time worked on the machine, this cannot be reset.



The bobbin winder is a separate motor and winds the big M class bobbins within 30 seconds! I love the big bobbins, they last a long time.



The bobbin area itself is easily accessible for cleaning with no lids to remove.  It is quick and easy.  I use a soft, long handled artists brush to clean out the lint.



I have had a few tension issues but have been able to resolve them myself.  I’ve discovered that the machine can be a bit fussy with the threads it likes. It does not like the poly core quilting thread I was using. Too linty. Tried a 100% polyester thread and it was fine.


Coming in at around £4250 in the UK, this machine  is affordable.  £10,000 for a long arm was NEVER going to be an option for me unless I won the lottery.


I am truly happy with the Q’nique and would recommend it to anyone.
Here are some samples of my quilting done with the Q’nique so far.

















If you are thinking of buying a Q’nique, go and try one. If you are a quilter like me, you will love it!!

FREE MOTION MACHINE QUILTING


Free motion machine quilting is a creative and fun way to extend your skill set and enhance your needlework. This method of quilting allows you to try designs that are otherwise difficult with other types of machines. If you’re looking for a way to create professional and award-worthy finished pieces, you should give this method of quilting a try. Free motion quilting allows you to try new finishing techniques, including these three.

The Technique

Free motion machine quilting allows you to create designs like background patterns that enhance your finished piece of work. Some common designs include swirls, spirals, flowers and scrolls. You’ll need to spend plenty of time practicing when you first start to try free motion machine quilting, as it may feel uncomfortable to you. Try out some small projects such as baby bibs or placemats rather than going all out on a queen-sized quilt.

Practicing Free Motion Machine Quilting

Get set up with a spool of 50 weight, 100% cotton thread in both the machine and the bobbin. Choose a thread color that contrasts with the fabric you’re using. Set your machine up with a universal 80/12 needle.

Getting Started

You do not need to baste together the layers of fabric before doing any free motion machine quilting. Snip any loose threads from your layers of fabric and remove any safety pins holding the layers together. Free motion quilting works best if you set your machine to make tiny stitches, at the rate of 20 to 30 per inch. Use your fingertips to slowly guide the fabric under the needle. Make a short chain of stitches, one-half inch at a time, to test the gauge. Once you’re happy with the gauge, you can continue with the project.

Creating a Project with Your Own Designs

As you move toward the center of the fabric, look ahead to where the needle will be next. Don’t focus on where the needle is now. Keep the machine’s speed steady as you guide the fabric. As you’re working, do the free motion stitching for binding before you do the fill-in areas. The fill-in areas may cause some bunching or gathering of the fabric. Be sure to distribute your stitching evenly over the entire quilt. You can sketch out your own free-form pattern and draw it with disappearing ink, or just make up the free motion stitching pattern as you go along.

MID ARM QUILTING MACHINES FOR HOME USE

 Mid Arm Quilting Machines For Home Use
There are many factors to consider when you dream about purchasing one of the mid arm quilting machines for home use.

Price

The cost of a mid arm is usually between $4,000 and $9,000, so you might consider buying a demo from a local quilt shop or at a quilt show where the retailers or manufacturers are anxious to make sales. A long arm machine can range from $5,000 to $35,000, usually needs its own room, and could cause a quilter to have to start a home business to help pay for the machine. Quilters may be able to get a good deal if they can find a second hand machine in good shape.

Space needed

Mid arm quilting machines for home use are smaller machines than the long arm but are larger than a sewing machine. Throat space for a mid arm goes from 12 to 17 inches whereas the long arm is usually mounted on a frame and runs from 8 feet to 14 feet in length with a width of 4 feet to 8 feet. A machine that can do a king-size quilt will require a room approximately 20 feet long by 10 feet wide, and that may not be possible inside a home and could require a separate shop.

How mid arm compares to long arm

With a mid arm, quilts still need to be basted, the operator can sit down while quilting where standing is required with a long arm, the quilter is creating a design while having to push the quilt around manually and there is no computer guided system which enables patterns to be purchased and loaded into the system.

Practice required

Think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to learning the quirks of the system. No quilter will be able to quilt like a professional right when the machine comes out of the box. The new owner will need to patiently practice and get comfortable with the machine and learn which thread works best and how to adjust the tension and so much more. Stitch regulators also take some getting used to.

Conclusion

Choose one of the best mid arm quilting machines for home use that satisfies your budget and your personal needs of whether it will be used quite often or just occasionally and whether you prefer to do larger or smaller projects. It will help to finish those gorgeous quilt tops that you have lovingly created.

 Machine Quilting Frame
The Importance of Having Specialized Equipment for Sewing Quilts

A machine quilting frame is an essential piece of equipment for hobbyists or commercial sewers making patchwork, pieced or embroidery embellished quilts designed as coverlets for beds. Large sections of cotton or wool fabrics are difficult to maneuver on traditional sewing machines with small work areas. Fortunately, manufacturers have worked with knowledgeable quilters to develop a machine quilting frame that is commonly known as a long arm that allows stretching fabrics with clasps along the devices to hold it firmly in place. Anyone stitching the layers of a quilt together or creating embroidery stitches needs the ability of seeing the entire item with this specialized device.

Vital Features to Look for When Buying Quilt Frames for Home or Commercial Use

At the same time, the machine quilting frame must hold the fabric tautly to permit accurate stitching to create the most beautiful design without errors. A manufacturer of devices meant for making quilts must also have several models to choose from in different price points to meet the needs of commercial or home sewers. Some of the features that shoppers look for when buying a machine quilting frame are:

Sturdy Rolling Bars – To Hold Fabrics In Place In Different Sections
Surface Is Appropriate Size – To Hold A Sewing Machine
Smooth Carriage System – To Provide Great Stitching
Having Several Rails Or Rollers – Enough To Hold Fabric Off The Floor
Type Of Material – Traditional Wood, Heavy Steel Or Lightweight Aluminum
Adjustable Height – Height Adjusts With Legs For Sitting Or Standing Work
Storage Capabilities – Foldable For Storage In Small Homes Or Businesses
Adjustable Frame – For Working On Crib Quilts To King-Size Items
Accessories – Accessories Available For Specialized Projects
Warranty – Company Provides Warranty For Repairs Or Replacement
How to Find Well Made Quilt Frames at an Online Store

In addition to the above features, many quilters want the ability to baste several fabrics together before placing the layers of materials on a machine quilting frame while others want to stitch without this step. The ability to place the quilt quickly in the frame makes it possible to begin sewing items right away, leading to saving time for everyone and increasing profits for commercial sewers. All of the mechanisms on the machines require testing by manufacturers to ensure the components do not harm fabrics by making holes or discolorations. In addition, the machines should have safety covers in place over moving components to avoid injuries to the hands or fingers. A good way for quilters to find quality frames for sewing is to look at an online retailer that provides full color photographs and detailed descriptions of products.
